### Description

A study of the design and implementation of intelligent computer systems that can learn, plan, and solve problems autonomously. In addition to examining techniques for designing intelligent software agents, students investigate the social, political, and ethical implications of intelligent systems. Through hands-on activities that often require team-work, students explore the application of artificial intelligence methods in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and video game development. During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations.

Prerequisite: CMPSC 102.

Distribution Requirements: QR, SP.

### Objectives

Complex real-world problems, such as web search, speech/face recognition, machine translation, and autonomous driving, involve rigorous solutions from the field of artificial intelligence or AI. This course will introduce students to the foundational principles that drive these intelligent applications and offer an opportunity to practice implementing some of these systems. Areas of discussion include, but are not limited to probabilistic methods, learning, game playing, Markov decision processes, graphical models, natural language processing, virtual reality, and logic. The main goal of the course is to equip students with the tools to tackle new AI problems you might encounter in life by learning how to determine when an AI approach is appropriate for a given situation, being able to select AI method and implement it. 

The course will introduce students to the theory and practice of artificial intelligence while covering both the
well-established and the cutting-edge areas of the discipline. The course also invites students to assess the
correctness of their implementations and conduct both analytical and empirical evaluations of the performance of the AI systems while considering their  social, political, and ethical implications. Moreover, the course will ask students to implement small- and medium-scale intelligent
systems and to use a wide variety of relevant AI tools. In addition to improving their teamwork skills, students
will enhance their ability to write and speak about intelligent systems in a clear and concise fashion. 

### Outcomes

At the completion of this class, a student must be comfortable with the fundamental theory and practical techniques in artificial intelligence and be aware of the current research in the area.  Students should be able to recognize new problems that may be solved using artificial intelligence methods and implement a complete application that uses them to solve the stated problem. Students must develop and apply a strong knowledge of analytical and empirical techniques that they can use to characterize and predict the performance of intelligent systems. Finally, students should be comfortable discussing and arguing the philosophical, ethical, social and political issues surrounding intelligent systems.

#### Class activities

All students are required to actively participate during all of the class sessions. During nearly all class sessions, you will be required to complete and submit class activities (individually and in teams). You will receive a checkmark grade (1) if you complete more than 70% of the activity; otherwise you will reeive a 0.

#### Conceptual Challenges

At the end of each week (starting with week 2), students will receive one problem, often containing subparts, to solve. These challenge problems are conceptual in nature and do not require any programming.

#### Lab assignments

Lab assignments invite students to explore different techniques for designing, implementing, evaluating, and documenting software solutions to challenging problems that often have a connection to real-world concerns.  To best ensure that students are ready to develop software in both other classes at Allegheny College and after graduation, students will complete most of the lab assignments in teams. The evaluation for each lab assignment will include a code review, demonstration, and performance assessment. 

#### Course project

This project will present you with an opportunity to design and implement a correct and carefully evaluated intelligent system for a particular problem. You will select an application for an intelligent system that you would like to pursue.

#### Assignment submission

All assignments have a stated due date and are to be turned in electronically on that due date. By submitting each assignment a student pledges that they have complied with Allegheny Honor Code. You must follow assignments instructions for submitting your completed programs in order for them to be graded.
Late assignments will be accepted for up to one week past the assigned due date with a 15% penalty. All of the late assignments must be submitted at the beginning of the session that is scheduled one week after the due date. Unless special arrangements are made with the course instructor, no assignments will be accepted after the late deadline.

#### Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend all of the class and laboratory sessions. There are two types of excused absences: 1) the one you notify the instructor about in advance (for example, if you have a job interview during the class/lab time or have a religious observance), 2) the one that occurs due to a documented emergency or illness. If you will not be able to attend a session, please let the instructor know at least two days in advance to describe your situation. In case you missed a class because of an emergency or an illness, please notify the instructor as soon as possible. In both cases the instructor will work with you to get you caught up. Students who miss more than five unexcused sessions will have their final grade in the course reduced by one letter grade. If you need to miss class due to a religious observance, please speak to me in advance to make appropriate arrangements.

#### Communication

Various digital channels are used in this course for communication, including email, Discord, and the GitHub issue tracker. Additionally, the course website is used to store the link to the course GitHub Organization, which will contain course syllabus, course schedule and the assignments. Students are responsible for regularly checking all platforms to ensure that the important messages are not being missed.

#### Allegheny College statement of community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

#### Honor code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work.  It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

#### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the course instructor. Students who need the course instructor's assistance should schedule an appointment through her [Office Hour Calendar](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/jjumadinova/schedule).

#### Assistance outside of the course

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which interfere with your ability to participate in or complete course assignments, let me know immediately. Do not wait until the last day of class to ask for exceptions to what is stated in this syllabus.
